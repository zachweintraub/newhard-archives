Name of Project: The Newhard Archive

Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal: This project is intended as a custom alternative distribution solution for films produced by Newhard Entertainment. The current slate includes six feature-length films and five short/mid-length films. Additionally, each film will be accompanied by a set of additional content, for example: trailers, texts written by the filmmaker(s), scripts, links to related reviews/interviews, photo galleries, soundtracks, etc. Users will register for the site with an email address and pay a one-time fee that will grant them unlimited access to all content. Unregistered users will still be able to navigate the site, but with limited access to content (e.g. trailers only). The site will be navigated via a timeline interface that is populated with films and organized based on their year of production.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Site features an interactive timeline UI populated with films
Navigating to various films populates a view with the film itself as well as a navigable sub-index of all associated content
